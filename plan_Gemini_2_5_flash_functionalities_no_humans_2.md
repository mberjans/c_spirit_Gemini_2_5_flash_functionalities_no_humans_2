# **Detailed Plan for AI-Driven Ontology Development and Information Extraction in Plant Metabolomics (AIM2 Project)**

## **I. Executive Summary**

The AIM2 project is poised to revolutionize metabolomics data enrichment by constructing a robust, annotated metabolites network, focusing on plant functional roles and resilience. This report outlines a comprehensive, fully automated Python-based solution designed to achieve these objectives without any manual intervention. The core of this strategy involves leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and synthetic data generation across all phases of ontology development and information extraction. From programmatic acquisition and intelligent trimming of diverse biological ontologies to sophisticated entity and relationship extraction from scientific literature, every step is engineered for maximum automation and scalability. The proposed architecture emphasizes a central OWL-based ontology managed programmatically, supported by AI-driven validation and self-correction mechanisms, ensuring high data quality and reproducibility. This plan details the technical approaches, key Python libraries, and the strategic application of AI to replace traditional human efforts, delivering a powerful and efficient system for deeper biological discovery.

## **II. Introduction to the AIM2 Project and Automation Imperatives**

The AIM2 project is a critical initiative aimed at developing a comprehensive, annotated metabolites network. Its primary goal is to enrich existing metabolomics data, thereby providing more profound biological context, particularly concerning the functional roles of plant metabolites and their contribution to plant resilience. Achieving these deliverables necessitates advanced computational functionalities, with Python serving as the foundational programming language due to its extensive ecosystem for data science, machine learning, and natural language processing.

A fundamental requirement for the AIM2 project is the complete elimination of manual efforts. This dictates that all processes, from ontology development to information extraction, must be fully automated, with artificial intelligence (AI) and/or synthetic data generation replacing human intervention wherever possible. This imperative drives the architectural decisions and tool selections detailed in this report, ensuring a scalable, reproducible, and highly efficient research pipeline. The emphasis is on creating stand-alone, importable Python programs that function autonomously, without reliance on Docker, user interfaces (UIs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for external interaction beyond data acquisition, or web-based components. This design philosophy underpins the entire technical plan, ensuring that the project delivers a truly automated solution for biological insight generation.

## **III. Automated Ontology Development and Management**

This section delineates the systematic approach to programmatically acquiring, refining, and integrating disparate biological ontologies into a cohesive, project-specific knowledge framework. The entire process is designed to be automated, leveraging Python libraries and advanced AI techniques to minimize human oversight.

### **A. Ontology Acquisition and Initial Processing**

The initial phase focuses on programmatically obtaining existing ontologies in their native formats and preparing them for seamless integration into the AIM2 project's knowledge base.

The foundational component for managing and manipulating ontologies will be Owlready2. This robust Python library is specifically designed for ontology-oriented programming, enabling the loading, parsing, and in-memory representation of OWL 2.0 ontologies.1 Its support for various OWL serialization formats, including RDF/XML, OWL/XML, and NTriples, ensures broad compatibility with existing biological ontologies. The capability of

Owlready2 to handle large ontologies efficiently is crucial for a project of this scale.

To address the diverse landscape of biological ontologies, specialized API integrations are essential. For Chemont classification, which is based on the ChEBI database, the libChEBIpy Python library will be utilized. This library provides programmatic access to ChEBI, including automated download and local storage of its flat files, which can then be parsed and integrated into the Owlready2 environment.4 Similarly, for accurate species identification and taxonomic data,

NCBI-taxonomist offers a dedicated Python command-line tool. It facilitates the collection and management of taxonomic information from the NCBI Taxonomy Database by querying via Entrez, mapping taxonomic IDs (taxids) to names, resolving lineages, and extracting subtrees, all while storing data locally.7 This direct integration with authoritative sources ensures the accuracy of source annotations.

For other critical ontologies such as Plant Ontology (PO), Plant Experimental Condition Ontology (PECO), Gene Ontology (GO), Trait Ontology (TO), and ChemFont, access will primarily be facilitated through the EBI Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) API. The ols-client Python library provides a programmatic interface to OLS, allowing for the retrieval of ontology metadata and, importantly, direct OWL file download URLs.9 ChemFont specifically notes its availability as a downloadable OWL file.14 For NP Classifier, ontology data is available in JSON format.18 The Plant Metabolic Network (PMN) provides BioCyc format flat files and a

biopax.owl file upon license agreement, which can be programmatically handled.22

The heterogeneity of ontology access methods and file formats necessitates a layered abstraction for robust integration. The challenge is that ontologies are not uniformly accessible or formatted. Some offer dedicated Python APIs, others rely on centralized services like OLS, and some are direct file downloads in various formats. This diverse landscape could introduce significant friction for a fully automated pipeline. The solution involves implementing specific modules for each acquisition method—API clients, direct downloaders, and format converters—all feeding into a unified internal representation. Owlready2's ability to load various OWL formats and represent them as consistent Python objects makes it an ideal candidate for this unified model.1 This architecture ensures that downstream processing can operate consistently, irrespective of the original source, promoting system robustness and ease of maintenance as new ontologies or formats are encountered.

The strategic use of Owlready2 as the central ontology backbone is paramount. Its comprehensive capabilities for OWL 2.0 ontology manipulation, including loading, modification, saving, and reasoning, position it as the core component for the AIM2 project's ontology development.1 All acquired ontological data, regardless of its initial format or access method, will ultimately be converted or mapped into

Owlready2's Python object model. This centralization simplifies subsequent steps such as trimming, merging, and defining relationships, as all operations can be performed within a single, consistent framework. This is fundamental for building a coherent "backbone annotated metabolites network."

Bridging JSON-based ontologies to formal OWL is a critical step for enhanced semantic interoperability. The NP Classifier ontology, while valuable for structural annotation, is primarily available as a JSON file.18 JSON is a data serialization format and inherently lacks the formal semantics (e.g., explicit hierarchical relationships, property definitions, logical axioms) that define a true OWL ontology. To fully integrate NP Classifier's structural annotations into the broader ontology and enable semantic reasoning, its JSON structure must be programmatically converted into OWL. Tools like

linkml-convert can translate JSON data into RDF/OWL format, provided a LinkML schema is defined for the JSON structure.26 Alternatively,

pyld, a JSON-LD processor, can convert JSON-LD to RDF, which Owlready2 can then load.27 The

obographs project also suggests graph-oriented JSON models that can be mapped to OWL.28 This conversion is not merely a format change; it is a semantic enrichment process that transforms raw data into structured knowledge, making it interoperable with other OWL ontologies and enabling logical inference. This ensures that all integrated data contributes to a truly "enriched" network.

### **B. Automated Ontology Trimming and Filtering**

The project requires reducing the size and complexity of imported ontologies to a manageable, domain-relevant subset for plant metabolomics and resilience, entirely without manual intervention.

For Gene Ontology (GO), a direct and established method for complexity reduction involves leveraging goatools. This library can map comprehensive GO terms to a more concise GOslim subset.29

goatools also supports filtering based on statistical significance, a feature that can be adapted to identify and retain terms most relevant to the project's scope.

For broader and more nuanced trimming based on "relevance" to plant metabolomics, LLM-driven semantic filtering will be employed. This involves using LLMs to assess the relevance of ontology terms, including their labels, definitions, and hierarchical context, and prompting the LLM to assign a relevance score or categorize them as relevant/irrelevant. Sophisticated prompt engineering, utilizing zero-shot or few-shot techniques with contextual information, will guide the LLM's understanding of "relevance".30 For instance, a prompt might ask: "Given the ontology term '' with definition '' and parent terms '', how relevant is this term to the study of plant metabolites and their role in plant resilience? Rate on a scale of 1-5 and explain." Principles from the MILA framework, which iteratively queries LLMs for "borderline cases" using a prioritized depth-first search, can be adapted to focus LLM attention and minimize computational overhead during this process.35 This allows for more targeted and efficient trimming.

Finally, explicit rule-based pruning will be implemented to filter terms based on predefined criteria specific to the project's scope. For example, rules can be defined to automatically exclude human-specific traits from ChemFont or filter out non-plant species from the NCBI Taxonomy, ensuring that the resulting ontology is precisely tailored to plant metabolomics.

The approach to ontology trimming and filtering combines domain-specific tools with LLM-driven semantic pruning to achieve both efficiency and accuracy. The user's requirement to significantly reduce the number of anatomical terms, for example, highlights the need for precise pruning. While goatools offers a direct and efficient solution for GO terms by mapping them to GOslim 29, this method is not universally applicable across all ontologies. For other ontologies, or for more granular relevance filtering, LLMs become indispensable. The MILA framework demonstrates how LLMs can identify semantic correspondences and filter borderline cases based on textual descriptions.35 This suggests a powerful hybrid strategy: applying existing, efficient domain-specific tools where available, and then leveraging LLMs with carefully constructed prompts for broader semantic filtering. This combination ensures that both established reduction methods and advanced semantic understanding are utilized, leading to a highly efficient and accurate trimming process without any manual review of individual terms.

Encoding specific "relevance" criteria directly into LLM prompts is crucial for automated, contextual trimming. The challenge of "trimming and filtering" lies in programmatically defining what constitutes a "manageable and useful" subset. LLMs' ability to interpret textual descriptions 35 and respond to detailed prompts 30 offers a solution to this qualitative problem. By embedding the project's specific relevance criteria—such as "focus on plant primary/secondary metabolism" or "relevance to plant stress response"—directly into the LLM prompts, the model can perform a semantic filtering operation. This moves beyond simple keyword matching to a more sophisticated, context-aware pruning process. The use of few-shot examples within the prompt can further refine the LLM's understanding of what constitutes a "relevant" or "irrelevant" term for the AIM2 project 30, directly replacing human judgment in this critical step.

### **C. Refined Ontology Scheme Development**

This phase involves programmatically constructing the core ontology structure, defining the project's specific categories (Structural Annotation, Source, and Function) and custom hierarchical relationships.

The top-level categories "Structural Annotation," "Source," and "Function" will be defined as OWL classes using Owlready2.3 This Pythonic approach allows the entire ontology schema to be expressed as code, facilitating version control and automated updates. Custom object properties, such as "is\_a", "made\_via", "accumulates\_in", and "affects", will be programmatically defined as

ObjectProperty or DataProperty classes within Owlready2. Their domain and range will be specified to enforce semantic constraints, ensuring logical consistency within the ontology. For example, defining Metabolite and PlantTrait as Thing classes, then declaring affects as an ObjectProperty with domain=\[Metabolite\] and range=, explicitly models the desired relationship. Owlready2 further supports advanced property types like FunctionalProperty, InverseFunctionalProperty, TransitiveProperty, and SymmetricProperty 39, enabling richer semantic definitions.

LLMs will be leveraged as intelligent assistants for schema enrichment. By providing the LLM with the high-level categories and the already trimmed ontologies as context, the LLM can be prompted to suggest sub-categories or additional properties within the "Structural," "Source," and "Function" aspects, aligning with the project's goals. LLMs possess the capability to "extract concepts and relations" and propose "additional related concepts" 41, thereby automating the iterative process of identifying and structuring terms within the new scheme.

For automated derivation of complex hierarchical relationships, SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) rules will be implemented within Owlready2 or through integration with a Python rule engine like pyKE.42 These rules enable the inference of new relationships based on existing ones. For instance, if a rule states that "if Compound A

is\_a Flavonoid" and "Flavonoid accumulates\_in Leaf", then the system can automatically infer "Compound A accumulates\_in Leaf." This capability moves beyond simple asserted facts to a dynamic, reasoning-enabled knowledge base, providing deeper biological insights automatically. This approach ensures that the ontology is not merely a static hierarchy but a dynamic, inferential system.

The programmatic definition of the ontology schema is a critical aspect, enabling version control and automated evolution. The user's request for a refined ontology scheme with specific categories and relationships can be directly translated into OWL axioms using Owlready2's Pythonic API.24 This means the entire ontology schema can be defined as Python code and managed under version control, such as Git. This capability is a significant departure from traditional, manual ontology editors, allowing for automated updates, collaborative development, and a clear audit trail for ontology evolution. This directly supports the "no manual efforts" and "AI should replace human efforts" principles, making the ontology a living, evolving component of the project.

LLMs serve as intelligent assistants for ontology schema population and refinement. Given the "no manual efforts" constraint, traditional human ontology engineering is not an option for populating the ontology with specific terms and ensuring comprehensive coverage. LLMs bridge this gap by acting as automated knowledge extractors and suggestors. By prompting an LLM with the high-level categories (Structural, Source, Function) and providing the trimmed ontologies as context, the LLM can extract concepts and relations and suggest additional related concepts.41 This automates the iterative process of identifying and structuring terms within the new scheme, significantly reducing the manual burden of ontology engineering and ensuring that the ontology is comprehensive and well-structured.

Rule-based reasoning plays a vital role in the automated derivation of complex hierarchical relationships. The project explicitly requires managing intricate relationships such as "made\_via," "accumulates\_in," and "affects," and differentiating between broad and specific associations (e.g., "involved in" versus "upregulates"). Owlready2's support for SWRL rules 42 and its integration with reasoners like HermiT 3 are key enablers. These rules allow the system to infer new, implicit relationships based on explicitly defined ones. For example, if a rule defines that a compound

is\_a precursor and a precursor made\_via a certain pathway, then the system can automatically deduce that the compound made\_via that pathway. This capability transforms the ontology from a static hierarchy into a dynamic, inferential system, automatically providing deeper biological insights. Python rule engines like pyKE 45 can be integrated for more complex logical inference, further enhancing the system's ability to deduce novel knowledge.

### **D. Automated Ontology Integration and Alignment**

This crucial stage focuses on merging terms from various source ontologies into the refined AIM2 ontology scheme, with automated resolution of semantic conflicts and redundancies.

The primary tool for achieving this will be OntoAligner, a Python toolkit specifically designed for ontology alignment (OA).46

OntoAligner supports a variety of methods, including lightweight techniques (e.g., fuzzy matching), retrieval-based approaches (utilizing semantic similarity via vector representations, such as sentence-transformer), and LLM-based methodologies.46 This toolkit will form the core of identifying correspondences between terms from the diverse source ontologies and the refined AIM2 ontology.

LLM-driven semantic conflict resolution is central to automating the traditionally human-intensive process of ontology merging. For ambiguous or conflicting terms identified by OntoAligner, LLMs will be leveraged with sophisticated prompts. These prompts will provide the LLM with definitions, synonyms, and hierarchical contexts of the conflicting terms from different ontologies, asking it to determine equivalence or suggest a mapping to a term in the refined AIM2 ontology. An example prompt could be: "Are '' (from Ontology A, defined as '') and '' (from Ontology B, defined as '') semantically equivalent in the context of plant metabolomics? If not, suggest the most appropriate term from the AIM2 ontology for each." OntoAligner's support for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) aligners is particularly relevant here.46 This hybrid method integrates the retrieval of relevant external knowledge (e.g., from the source ontologies themselves or other knowledge bases) before the LLM generates alignment decisions, significantly enhancing accuracy and contextual understanding.

Following alignment and mapping, a programmatic deduplication step will be implemented to ensure that semantically equivalent terms from different sources are represented by a single, canonical term in the refined ontology. This involves systematically comparing mapped terms and merging redundant entries to maintain a clean and consistent knowledge base.

Automated ontology alignment is paramount for achieving semantic interoperability across the diverse data sources. The project's success hinges on integrating terms from multiple ontologies, including Chemont, NP Classifier, PMN, PO, NCBI Taxonomy, PECO, GO, Trait Ontology, and ChemFont. This is a classic ontology alignment problem, and manual resolution is explicitly forbidden. OntoAligner provides a direct, Python-based solution that offers a range of alignment techniques, including LLM-driven methods.46 This is crucial because simply loading disparate ontologies does not make them interoperable; their terms must be explicitly aligned to ensure that, for example, "glucose" from one ontology is recognized as the same "glucose" in another. Without this automated alignment, the "backbone annotated metabolites network" would remain a collection of isolated data points rather than an integrated, semantically coherent knowledge graph.

LLM-driven semantic conflict resolution directly replaces manual expert review in ontology merging. Merging ontologies inevitably leads to semantic conflicts, such as terms with similar labels but different meanings, or truly redundant terms. Traditionally, resolving these conflicts requires substantial manual effort from domain experts. Given the "no manual efforts" constraint, LLMs offer a powerful, automated alternative. OntoAligner's support for LLM-based aligners 46 and the general capability of LLMs to interpret textual descriptions and contexts 30 can be leveraged. By providing LLMs with conflicting or ambiguous terms, their definitions, and their hierarchical positions, the LLM can be prompted to determine equivalence or suggest the most appropriate mapping. This transforms a labor-intensive, subjective task into an automated, AI-driven process, ensuring the semantic consistency and quality of the integrated ontology.

The text2term library offers a flexible approach for post-extraction mapping to the integrated ontology. While OntoAligner focuses on aligning the foundational source ontologies themselves, the project also requires mapping *extracted entities* from scientific literature to the *defined ontology terms*. text2term is explicitly designed for this task, facilitating "mapping free-text descriptions of entities... to ontology terms".47 This suggests a two-pronged mapping strategy: first, align the foundational ontologies into a refined scheme. Second, use

text2term (or a similar LLM-based classification approach) to standardize the extracted entities from literature against this newly built, refined ontology. This ensures that all extracted information is semantically consistent and linked to the project's canonical knowledge representation, which is vital for downstream analysis and generating deeper biological insights.

### **E. Ontology Storage and Version Control**

The final step in ontology management involves storing the developed and refined ontology in accessible formats and programmatically managing its evolution.

The refined and integrated ontology will be primarily stored in OWL/XML format. This preserves its full semantic richness, including hierarchical relationships, properties, and logical axioms, ensuring that no valuable information is lost during storage. Owlready2 provides direct functionality for saving the in-memory ontology to an OWL/XML file.1 For simpler access and compatibility with certain tools or data analysis pipelines, a flattened CSV representation of key ontology terms and their relationships can be generated.

EMMOntoPy's ontoconvert supports conversion between formats, and LinkML can convert to CSV from its schema-driven model.26 This dual-format approach provides accessibility without compromising semantic depth.

Programmatic version control is essential for automated ontology evolution and reproducibility. The requirement to store the ontology on GitHub necessitates an automated versioning system. A Python script utilizing GitPython will be implemented to manage the ontology files (OWL, CSV exports) on a GitHub repository. This script will automate the committing of changes after each significant ontology modification (e.g., after trimming, integration, or refinement steps) and the tagging of releases for major ontology versions. This ensures a complete audit trail of ontology evolution, which is vital for a research project like AIM2, as it allows for tracking changes, reverting to previous versions if needed, and ensuring that the ontology's development is transparent and reproducible. This also directly supports the concept of "ontology evolution" mentioned in the context of ontology alignment evaluation.49

Automated metadata generation and documentation will be handled by pyLODE. This tool automatically generates human-readable documentation (static HTML) directly from the OWL ontology.50 This ensures that the ontology's structure and content are well-documented for understanding and future maintenance, and it also encourages good annotation practices within the ontology itself.

OWL will serve as the definitive source of truth for semantic fidelity, with CSV exports generated for accessibility. While CSV is a simple format, it fundamentally loses the rich semantic relationships, properties, and logical axioms that define a formal ontology. OWL, as the native format for formal ontologies, preserves this critical information.1 Therefore, the OWL file will be the primary, definitive storage format for the integrated ontology. CSV representations will be generated as derivative exports solely for specific use cases, such as simple lookup tables or import into tools that do not natively support OWL. This dual-format strategy ensures both semantic integrity and practical accessibility, aligning with the project's goal of deriving "deeper biological insights."

Leveraging LinkML for flexible schema definition and automated interconversion offers an additional layer of robustness. LinkML provides a powerful framework for defining schemas that can then be converted to various formats, including JSON, YAML, and RDF/OWL.26 While

Owlready2 handles direct OWL manipulation, LinkML could serve as an intermediate schema definition layer, particularly if the refined ontology's "Structural Annotation, Source, and Function" categories are initially conceptualized or managed in a more human-readable format like YAML. LinkML-convert can then automate the conversion to OWL for Owlready2 and to CSV for simpler exports. This approach adds flexibility and robustness to the schema definition and data interconversion process, ensuring that the ontology is not only machine-readable but also highly maintainable and adaptable over time.

## **IV. Automated Literature Information Extraction using LLMs**

This section details the process of building a comprehensive literature corpus and extracting structured biological information using advanced LLM techniques, entirely without manual intervention.

### **A. Comprehensive Corpus Building**

The initial step involves programmatically building a comprehensive corpus of plant chemical literature from diverse sources, ensuring the data is clean and appropriately chunked for LLM processing.

Automated literature acquisition will prioritize official APIs for reliable and scalable data retrieval. For PubMed and PubMed Central, Biopython.Bio.Entrez will be used for programmatic searching and downloading of abstracts and full-text XMLs.7 This method is highly reliable as it adheres to NCBI's EUtils guidelines, ensuring consistent access and compliance. For specific scientific journals or PDFs not covered by Entrez, a robust, rate-limited web scraping module will be implemented. This module will incorporate strategies to handle common bot protection mechanisms, such as dynamic delays, user-agent rotation, and potentially headless browser automation if absolutely necessary, though direct API access is preferred for stability. Priority will be given to journals that offer programmatic access or bulk downloads. For PDF-only articles, Python libraries like

PyPDF2 or pdfminer.six will be used for text extraction. Any available APIs for external services from specific scientific journals or publishers will be integrated to facilitate programmatic access to their content, as explicitly requested.

Text preprocessing and intelligent chunking are paramount for maximizing LLM context utilization and extraction quality. A dedicated text processing pipeline will clean raw text by removing headers, footers, special characters, and boilerplate text, particularly from PDF extractions. Standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries such as spaCy or NLTK will be employed for tokenization, sentence segmentation, and basic text normalization. Intelligent text chunking strategies are crucial to prepare input for LLMs, given their token limits. Libraries like langchain's TokenTextSplitter will be used to create overlapping chunks that preserve contextual information while fitting within the LLM's context window.51 The design of this chunking strategy (e.g., fixed size with overlap, or context-aware chunking) will be carefully considered to ensure each chunk contains sufficient semantic context for accurate Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relationship Extraction (RE), directly impacting the quality of LLM-based information extraction. Finally, keyword-based searching and filtering of abstracts and full texts will be applied during or after acquisition to focus the corpus specifically on plant chemical literature relevant to metabolites and resilience.

### **B. Named Entity Recognition (NER) with LLMs**

This phase focuses on automatically identifying and extracting specific biological entities from the literature corpus using LLMs, ensuring high precision and consistency.

The selection of appropriate LLMs (e.g., Llama 70B, Gemma, GPT-4o) will be based on their demonstrated performance in biomedical NER tasks and their computational resource requirements, aligning with the project's standalone and importable program constraints.

Ontology-guided prompt engineering will be a cornerstone of the NER process. The LLM will be provided with the previously defined ontology terms and their definitions as part of the prompt. This approach explicitly guides the LLM to recognize entities that align with the project's specific ontology, transforming the NER task into an "ontology-constrained classification." For example, a prompt might instruct: "Extract all mentions of 'chemicals', 'metabolites', 'genes', 'species', 'plant anatomical structures', 'experimental conditions', 'molecular traits', 'plant traits', and 'human traits' from the following text. Map each extracted entity to its closest term in the provided ontology list. Output in JSON format: {entity\_type:}." This significantly improves precision, reduces hallucinations, and ensures that extracted entities are immediately mappable to the ontology, streamlining post-processing.30

Zero-shot prompting will be the initial approach.30 If performance requires enhancement, dynamic few-shot examples, generated from synthetic data (as discussed in Section V.A), will be incorporated to improve domain adaptation and accuracy for specific entity types.32 Contextual prompts, including relevant surrounding sentences, the abstract, or keywords, will be used to aid LLM disambiguation and improve extraction quality.30

A dedicated species normalization module will be integrated for robust species identification. Accurate species identification is critical for plant metabolomics. While general LLMs can perform NER, specialized biological entities often benefit from dedicated tools. NCBI-taxonomist is a robust Python tool specifically designed for programmatic access to NCBI Taxonomy.8 Integrating this as a dedicated module in the NER pipeline for species names ensures higher accuracy and consistency than relying solely on a general LLM. This module can normalize species mentions to official NCBI TaxIDs and resolve their lineages, which is essential for filtering irrelevant species and enriching the "Source" annotation in the ontology.

### **C. Relationship Extraction with LLMs**

This phase focuses on extracting complex relationships between identified entities from text, such as "affects", "made\_via", and "accumulates\_in", while differentiating between broad and specific associations.

Synthetic data generation will be crucial for training LLMs for relationship extraction, entirely replacing manual annotation efforts. This process involves:

1. **Defining Relation Triplets:** Programmatically define target relation triplets (head entity, relation type, tail entity) using terms from the refined ontology (e.g., (Metabolite, affects, PlantTrait)).  
2. **LLM-based Sentence Generation:** Utilize LLMs to generate diverse, contextually relevant sentences that exemplify these relation triplets.51 The generation process will ensure "relation dependence and diversity" and "semantic consistency" within the synthetic sentences.53  
3. **Automated Data Selection:** Implement a ranking-based data selection method to filter out noisy or low-quality synthetic sentences, ensuring a high-quality training dataset without any human review.54

LLM-based relationship extraction will employ sophisticated prompt engineering. Structured prompts will clearly define the entities and the target relationships, requesting output in a structured format (e.g., JSON or tabular format: Entity-1 | Entity-2 | Relationship).57 The prompts will be designed to differentiate between broad and specific associations (e.g., "involved in" versus "upregulates" or "induces expression") by providing explicit instructions and potentially examples to the LLM. This fine-grained relationship extraction is critical for capturing nuanced biological interactions.

Automated validation and self-correction techniques will be integrated to enhance the accuracy of relationship extraction. LLMs are prone to errors and hallucinations.59 To mitigate this, a multi-step process will be implemented:

1. **Initial Extraction:** The LLM performs an initial pass of relationship extraction.  
2. **Automated Verification:** A rule-based validation module (using libraries like Pointblank or pyvaru 61) will apply predefined logical constraints and rules derived from the ontology to check the extracted relationships for consistency and factual correctness. For example, a rule might check if a "made\_via" relationship connects a metabolite to a pathway, or if an "affects" relationship links a compound to a trait.  
3. **LLM Self-Correction:** If errors or inconsistencies are detected, the LLM will be prompted again with specific feedback, allowing it to review and correct its own output.59 This iterative refinement process, driven by automated feedback, ensures high-quality extracted relationships without human intervention.

## **V. Ontology Mapping and Post-processing**

This section details the critical steps of mapping extracted entities and relationships to the defined ontology terms, followed by normalization, deduplication, and formatting of the extracted data.

Automated mapping to the refined ontology is a key step. Extracted entities and relationships, identified during the NER and RE phases, will be mapped to the canonical terms within the project's refined ontology. This mapping can occur in two primary ways: either by providing LLMs with the ontology terms directly before extraction (as part of the prompt for NER/RE) or by mapping extracted entities to the ontology post-extraction. The latter approach will likely involve text2term, a Python library designed for mapping free-text descriptions to ontology terms.47 This ensures that all extracted information is standardized and linked to the central knowledge base.

Rule-based post-processing will be implemented for data quality assurance. After initial mapping, the extracted data will undergo a series of automated post-processing steps:

* **Normalization:** Entity names will be normalized to their canonical forms as defined in the ontology. This includes handling synonyms, variations in spelling, and different representations of the same entity.  
* **Deduplication:** Redundant facts or relationships extracted from different parts of the literature will be deduplicated to maintain a concise and non-redundant knowledge base.  
* **Formatting:** The extracted data will be formatted into a consistent structure suitable for specific databases or downstream analyses (e.g., RDF triples, tabular data).  
* **Species Identification and Filtering:** A dedicated module, potentially leveraging NCBI-taxonomist 8, will ensure robust species identification and filter out any irrelevant species that might have been broadly extracted by LLMs, focusing only on plant species. This ensures the relevance of the extracted data to the AIM2 project's plant-centric scope.

## **VI. Evaluation and Benchmarking**

A robust evaluation framework is essential to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the automated information extraction pipelines.

Synthetic gold standard generation will replace manual annotation for benchmarking extraction accuracy. The project explicitly aims to eliminate manual efforts, including the creation of gold standard test sets. Instead of manually annotating \~25 papers, synthetic data generation techniques will be employed to create labeled datasets that mimic real-world annotations. This involves programmatically generating diverse sentences or text snippets that contain known entities and relationships, then labeling them automatically based on predefined rules or LLM-generated ground truth.51 This approach provides a scalable and automated method for generating evaluation data.

Automated benchmarking of different LLM models will measure performance metrics. The performance of various LLM models (e.g., Llama, Gemma, GPT-4o) for entity and relationship extraction tasks will be benchmarked using the synthetically generated gold standard. Standard NLP evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 scores will be calculated automatically. This systematic comparison will guide the selection and optimization of LLMs for the project.

Automated self-correction and verification strategies will be implemented to continuously improve LLM outputs. LLMs are known to produce errors or "hallucinations".59 To address this without manual curation, the system will incorporate automated feedback loops. This involves:

1. **Internal Consistency Checks:** Applying rule-based validation (using Python rule engines like Pointblank or pyvaru 61) against the defined ontology to identify logically inconsistent or improbable extractions (e.g., a compound affecting a non-existent plant trait).  
2. **External Tool-Based Verification:** For certain types of extracted information (e.g., species names, chemical structures), external, authoritative tools or databases (like NCBI Taxonomy via NCBI-taxonomist 8) can be queried programmatically to verify the LLM's output.  
3. **LLM Re-prompting with Feedback:** If errors are detected by the automated verification steps, the LLM will be re-prompted with specific, structured feedback outlining the identified inconsistencies or inaccuracies.59 This iterative self-correction mechanism minimizes the need for human intervention in validating and correcting LLM outputs, ensuring continuous improvement of extraction accuracy.

## **VII. Data Visualization**

While the project explicitly states no UI or websites, the visualization of identified metabolites and their associated information is crucial for biological interpretation. This will be achieved through programmatic generation of data files compatible with existing visualization tools.

The system will integrate identified metabolites and their associated information into formats suitable for tools like the eFP browser. This involves generating data files (e.g., expression matrices, annotation files) that the eFP browser can consume to create heatmaps and visualize linkages between genes and metabolites. Similarly, metabolites will be projected onto metabolic pathways represented in resources like the Plant Metabolic Network (PMN). This will involve generating files (e.g., BioPAX, SBML) that can be loaded into pathway visualization software, allowing for automated mapping and contextualization of metabolites within known biochemical routes. The output of these visualization steps will be static image files or data files that can be directly loaded into the respective tools for offline analysis, adhering to the "no UI" constraint.

## **VIII. Compound Prioritization**

Automated methods will be developed to identify unique and non-redundant compounds from various databases and prioritize metabolites for further experimental testing.

The system will employ algorithms to identify unique and non-redundant compounds by comparing structural identifiers (e.g., SMILES, InChIKey) and canonicalizing chemical entities across different databases. This ensures that the network does not contain duplicate entries for the same metabolite.

Metabolites will be prioritized for further experimental testing based on predefined criteria, such as structural similarity to known compounds with desired properties (e.g., resilience-enhancing activity). This could involve cheminformatics libraries in Python (e.g., RDKit) to calculate structural fingerprints and similarity scores. The prioritization process will be entirely automated, ranking compounds based on their predicted relevance and novelty, guiding future experimental efforts without manual selection.

## **IX. Database and Tool Integration**

The developed ontology and base network will be integrated into existing tools or serve as the foundation for a new searchable database, and API interactions for external services will be established.

The developed ontology and the backbone annotated metabolites network will be integrated into existing bioinformatics tools where feasible, such as GNPS, MetaboAnalyst, or NP Classifier. This integration will involve generating data formats compatible with these tools (e.g., MGF for GNPS, specific CSV formats for MetaboAnalyst, JSON for NP Classifier annotations).

API interactions for external services and platforms will be developed to facilitate data exchange and enrichment. This includes utilizing the PubMed API for literature acquisition and exploring alternatives for PDF extraction with API access to ensure a fully automated data pipeline. The system will be designed to export the integrated ontology and extracted network data in standard formats (e.g., OWL, RDF, JSON-LD, CSV) that can be readily consumed by other bioinformatics tools or loaded into a new, purpose-built searchable database if required in the future. The emphasis remains on programmatic data exchange rather than building new UIs or web services.

## **X. Conclusions and Recommendations**

The detailed plan presented herein provides a robust, fully automated Python-based solution for the AIM2 project's objectives of ontology development and information extraction in plant metabolomics. By strategically leveraging LLMs and synthetic data, the proposed architecture effectively replaces traditional manual efforts, ensuring scalability, reproducibility, and high data quality.

The core strength of this approach lies in its layered abstraction for ontology management, with Owlready2 serving as the central backbone for a semantically rich OWL knowledge base. The integration of diverse ontology sources, including Chemont, NCBI Taxonomy, and various OBO/OWL ontologies, is achieved through dedicated Python clients and automated format conversions. The plan's innovative use of LLM-driven semantic filtering for ontology trimming and LLM-assisted schema enrichment significantly streamlines the creation of a refined, project-specific ontology. Furthermore, the incorporation of rule-based reasoning for inferring complex hierarchical relationships transforms the ontology into a dynamic, inferential system.

For information extraction, the reliance on programmatic literature acquisition via official APIs (e.g., Biopython.Bio.Entrez) and intelligent text chunking ensures an efficient corpus building process. The application of ontology-guided NER and LLM-based relationship extraction, powered by synthetic data generation and dynamic few-shot prompting, addresses the critical need for automated, high-precision information extraction without human annotation. Automated validation and self-correction mechanisms, utilizing rule-based checks and LLM re-prompting, are integral to maintaining the accuracy and trustworthiness of extracted facts.

**Key Recommendations:**

1. **Prioritize Incremental Development:** Given the complexity of integrating diverse ontologies and LLM capabilities, a phased development approach is recommended. Start with core ontology acquisition and trimming for a single, critical domain (e.g., structural annotation), then expand to other domains and integrate information extraction.  
2. **Invest in Synthetic Data Generation Frameworks:** The success of automated LLM training and evaluation hinges on high-quality synthetic data. Continuous refinement of synthetic data generation methods, including diversity and fidelity, is crucial for improving LLM performance and reducing reliance on manual gold standards.  
3. **Modularize Python Programs:** Design each functional component (e.g., ontology acquisition module, NER module, RE module) as stand-alone, importable Python packages. This promotes reusability, maintainability, and facilitates independent testing and updates, aligning with the user's explicit requirement for importable programs.  
4. **Establish Robust Error Handling and Logging:** In a fully automated pipeline, comprehensive error handling and detailed logging are paramount for debugging and monitoring process health. Implement robust mechanisms to capture, report, and potentially self-recover from issues during literature acquisition, LLM processing, and ontology manipulation.  
5. **Performance Optimization for LLMs:** Recognize that LLM inference can be computationally intensive. Continuously evaluate and optimize LLM usage through techniques like prompt optimization, efficient batching, and selecting models tailored for specific tasks and resource constraints to ensure practical scalability.  
6. **Maintain Ontology Governance:** Despite automation, a programmatic governance framework for the evolving ontology is essential. This includes automated version control, regular integrity checks, and a clear process for incorporating new terms or relationships identified by LLMs, ensuring the ontology remains consistent and valuable over time.

By adhering to this detailed plan and its underlying principles of automation and AI-driven processes, the AIM2 project can successfully develop a powerful, self-sustaining system for enriching metabolomics data and generating profound biological insights into plant resilience.
