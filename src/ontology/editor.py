"""
Ontology editor module for programmatic deletion of ontology entities.

This module provides functionality to delete classes, individuals, and properties
from OWL 2.0 ontologies using Owlready2. It includes comprehensive error handling,
input validation, and logging capabilities.

Key Features:
- Delete classes (with automatic instance cleanup)
- Delete individuals (with relationship cleanup)
- Delete properties (with relationship cleanup)
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- Thread-safe operations

Classes:
    EntityDeletionError: Custom exception for ontology deletion errors

Functions:
    delete_class: Delete a class from the ontology
    delete_individual: Delete an individual from the ontology
    delete_property: Delete a property from the ontology
